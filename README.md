VLSI-VHDL-Programs
This repo contains the VHDL Programs that I have completed in my M.Sc SEM-III Labs using Xilinx ISE Design Suite

A 4 bit adder with structural model
Full adder with structural model
Full adder with behavioural model
Ripple carry adder
A 4 bit subtractor
Full subtractor
A 4 bit multiplier
A 4x4 bit multiplier
Comprator 3 bit
4 Bit up counter with reset
16 bit up counter with reset
Alternate Up/Down counter with reset
4 Bit down counter
Each program has been written in file with .v extension. For example "1. Adder_4_Bit_Structural_Model" requires the following:

        Adder_1_Bit.v     // simple 1 bit adder file
        Adder_4_Bit.v     // 4 bit adder file that uses the 1 bit adders as a unit
        Adder_4_Bit_Testbench.v //Testbench file used to define possible cases to test the program against that
